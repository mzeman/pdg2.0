## Tile Types
Initial Tile Type Inventory:
- Pick one, dude.
- Rattata used Tackle!  ...wait you seriously rollder a 1?  You fainted.  Finish your drink.
- Pidgey used Quick Attack! Use that quickness to give 1 drink and take an extra turn.
-  Caterpie used String Shot!  It was super effective!  All other players may only move 1/2 of what they roll on their next turn (round up).
